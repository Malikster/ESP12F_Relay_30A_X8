Info gathered for ESP12F_Relay_30A_X8 relayboard (30312F30810)

WIFI RELAY MODULE 8CH CHANNELS 30A WITH ESP8066 ESP12F

The esp8266 eight way 30A relay development board is equipped with an ESP-12F wifi module, with all L/O LED output ports, and supports DC7-28V/5V power supply mode. It provides the Arduino development environment reference code, which is suitable for esp8266 secondary development and learning. Wireless control for smart home and other occasions.

FEATURES:

Write Port: GND, Rx, TX and 5V of esp8266 are respectively connected to GND of external TTL serial port module,

TX, Rx, 5V, IO0 need to connect with GND when downloading, and then disconnect the connection between IO0 and GND after downloading; Relay output:

NC: normally closed end, short-circuited with com before the relay is pulled and suspended after removal; COM: Public End;.

No: normally open, the relay is suspended before closing and short-circulated with com after closing.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

1. Built-in mature and stable esp-12f WiFi module with large 4m byte flash capacity.

2. The I/O port and the download port of the UART program of the WiFi module are all LED to facilitate secondary development; 3. Power supply mode supports dc7-28v/5V;

4. Built-in WiFi module, RST reset key and one soft key;

6. 8-way 5V/30A relay, which emits switching signal and is suitable for controlling loads with working voltage within AC 250V/dc30V.

7. On-board power indicator, relay indicator and single-module LED;

8. Two on-board 74HC595 change logs control the relay switch.
